# Project docs (detailed summaries)

This `docs/` folder contains detailed summaries of the notebooks in `books/`. Each page includes: a short description, key cells or functions, configuration variables to check before running, dependencies, and suggested usage.

Pages included (expanded):
- `rigt.md` — canonical merged downloader + OCR helper notebook (Colab friendly).
- `dupeshit.md` — deduplication utilities: hashes files, keeps oldest, moves duplicates.
- `doc_to_db.md` — prepares documents for database/vector ingestion; configurable paths.
- `find_dupes_hybrid.md` — merged comparison notebook for duplicate-finding logic.
- `colab_file_converter.md` — helper for converting files and formats in Colab workflows.
- `markdown_vector_embedder.md` — prepares Markdown files for vector embedding pipelines.
- `clay_city_times_2.md` — project-specific notebook for Clay City Times processing.
- `clay_city_times_vector_db.md` — vector-db oriented processing for Clay City Times.
- `articles_to_cleandb.md` — scripts to convert article sets into a cleaned DB-ready format.

If you'd like me to auto-generate per-notebook 'first-cell' extracts or create rendered HTML docs, I can do that next.

Additional resources:
- `comparisons_and_notes.md` — consolidated comparisons, merge notes, and recommended next steps.
- `comparisons_detailed.md` — a cell-by-cell mapping and example commands for key notebooks (`doc_to_db.ipynb`, `markdown_vector_embedder.ipynb`).

- [Comparisons & Notes](comparisons_and_notes.md) — consolidated comparisons, merge notes, and recommended next steps.
- [Detailed Comparisons](comparisons_detailed.md) — a cell-by-cell mapping and example commands for key notebooks (`doc_to_db.ipynb`, `markdown_vector_embedder.ipynb`).
